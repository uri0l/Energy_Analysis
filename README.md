## Energy Analysis of evaluating the interaction between the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein and its receptor on target cells, the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2) .

The primary goal is to identify the interface residues essential for complex formation. By assessing the
relative contribution of these residues through an Ala-Scanning experiment, we aim to comprehend
the binding process and interaction energy before and after complex formation.
